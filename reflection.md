# Reflection on AI-Assisted Development for IdeaBoard

Building IdeaBoard with AI support was as much about developing a product as it was about learning a new way of working. The process of collaborating with AI changed how I approached planning, coding, and debugging, and it forced me to think differently about prompting, iteration, and review.

## What Worked Well

The most obvious benefit was speed of scaffolding. Normally, setting up a Next.js frontend with Tailwind, Supabase, and auth flows takes hours of boilerplate. With AI, I was able to generate skeleton pages, configuration files, and database schemas in minutes. Even when details weren’t perfect, the AI provided a solid “90% starting point” that I could refine rather than starting from scratch.

Documentation generation was another major win. Having the AI output project specifications, architectural overviews, and even Cursor rules gave me clarity. These weren’t just artifacts for the repo—they became live guides that I could refer back to as the project grew.

Debugging support was also valuable. Tailwind v4 changes, RLS policy errors, and npm/npx issues are all frustrating blockers when working solo. AI wasn’t always 100% correct on first attempt, but having a “pair programmer” available to explain cryptic errors, suggest fixes, or point me toward root causes saved hours of trial and error.

Finally, SQL design and RLS policy drafting highlighted AI’s strength with repetitive but precise work. Generating idempotent policies and trigger functions is tedious by hand; with AI I could ask for secure defaults, then refine the output to match Supabase quirks.

## What Felt Limiting

The limitations came down to context gaps and surface-level correctness. AI often gave me “idealized” code that didn’t fully align with the exact versions of my tools—e.g., Tailwind v4’s changes, or Supabase’s slightly different PostgREST behavior. These mismatches created debugging loops where I had to backtrack and adjust manually.

Another limitation was verbosity without execution. AI is great at producing long snippets or even entire files, but not everything worked copy-paste. The challenge became balancing how much to trust the output versus when to slow down and verify details myself.

I also found prompting fatigue a real thing. If I asked vaguely, I’d get generic solutions. If I asked too specifically, I’d end up micromanaging the AI and losing time. Striking the right level of detail in prompts was an art.

Finally, styling felt clunky. AI could scaffold UI with Tailwind and shadcn/ui, but layouts often came out unpolished. Iterating on design required many back-and-forth prompts and manual tweaks.

## What I Learned

The key lesson was that AI is best treated like a junior teammate. It moves fast, generates scaffolds, and reduces repetitive work, but it also makes mistakes, skips edge cases, and needs review. I had to practice “active reviewing” instead of blindly accepting suggestions.

Prompting improved as I learned to:

Specify role + intent (“You are an expert in Next.js App Router, generate a page with...”).

Provide contextual anchors (“Use the SQL schema already defined in supabase/migrations”).

Ask for outputs in stages (first a spec, then the code).

Iteration was most effective when I combined AI with manual checkpoints: run the code, see the error, paste back the logs, and refine. This loop built trust in my own debugging process, not just in the AI.

AI accelerated the build, but it didn’t replace critical thinking. I learned that the real power isn’t in one-off code generation—it’s in using AI as a continuous assistant, from planning to debugging to documentation. IdeaBoard became not just a project, but a case study in how AI reshapes the developer workflow.
